## Hi there 👋

# 😃 About Me:
I’m an Operations Systems Engineer / Data Engineer who builds automation, integrations, and data pipelines that make operations faster and more reliable. I use Python, SQL, Airflow, Docker, Flask, and n8n to connect systems, standardize data, and ship tools like dashboards, trackers, and APIs that drive measurable improvements. Bilingual (EN/ES) and always tinkering with AI + automation projects..
